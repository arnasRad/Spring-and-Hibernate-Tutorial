Spring AutoWiring
* For dependency injection, Spring can use auto wiring
* Spring will look for a class that matches the property
	- matches by type: class or interface
* Spring will inject it automatically ... hence it is autowired

Autowiring Example
* Injecting com.arnasRad.dependencyinjection.FortuneService into a Coach implementation
	- Spring will scan @Components
	- Any one implements com.arnasRad.dependencyinjection.FortuneService interface???
	- If so, let's inject them. For example: HappyFortuneService
	
Constructor Injection
* Development Process
	1. Define the dependency interface and class
	2. Create a constructor in your class for injections
	3. Configure the dependency injecction with @AutoWired Annotation
