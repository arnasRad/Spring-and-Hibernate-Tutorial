Hibernate

What is Hibernate?
* A framework for persisting / saving Java objects in a database
	- www.hibernate.org

Benefits of Hibernate
	* Hibernate handles all of the low-level SQL
	* Minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop
	* Hibernate provides the Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)
* The developer defines mapping between Java class and database table


How does Hibernate relate to JDBC?
* Hibernate uses JDBC for all database communications


Must Have Java Development Kit (JDK)
http://www.luv2code.com/install-java

Required Software
To build Hibernate applications, you need the following:
1. Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
2. Database Server
3. Hibernate JAR files and JDBC Driver


* Hibernate Development Process
1. Add Hibernate Configuration file
2. Annotate Java Class
3. Develop Java Code to perform database operations


Terminology
* Entity class - Java class that is mapped to a database table

Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)
Java Class <--> Hibernate <--> Database table

Two Options for Mapping
* Option 1: XML config file (legacy)
* Option 2: Java Annotations (modern, preferred)

Java Annotations
1. Map class to database table
	- @Entity
	- @Table(name="table_name")
2. Map fields to database columns
	- @Id
	- @Column(name="column_name")


FAQ: Why are we using JPA Annotation instead of Hibernate?
Answer: Hibernate implements all of the JPA annotations
		The Hibernate team recommends the use of JPA annotations as a best practice
		


Hibernate CRUD features

Creating and Saving Java objects

* SessionFactory
	- reads the hibernate config file
	- creates Session objects
	- heavy-weight object (only create it once in your application
* Session
	- wraps a JDBC connection
	- main object used to save/retrieve objects
	- short-lived object
	- retrieved from SessionFactory

Save a Java Object
* create a student object
* start transaction
* save the student
* commit the transaction


Primary Keys
* Uniquely identifies each row in a table
* Must be a unique value
* Cannot contain NULL values
