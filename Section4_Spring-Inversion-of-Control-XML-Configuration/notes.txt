Spring Object Factory will give an appropriate implementation of a class based 
	on a configuration file or annotation so your app is configurable

Spring Container primary functions:
* Create and manage objects (Inversion of Control)
* Inject object's dependencies (Dependency Injection)

Configuring Spring Container:
* XML configuration file (legacy, but most legacy apps still use this)
* Java Annotations (modern)
* Java Source Code (modern)

Spring container is generically known as ApplicationContext

Spring Development Process:
1. Configure your Spring Beans
2. Create a Spring Container
3. Retrieve Beans from Spring Container

FAQ - frequently asked question
