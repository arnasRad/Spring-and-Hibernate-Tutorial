Spring MVC Form Validation

The Need for Validation
* Check the user input form for
	- required fields
	- valid numbers in a range
	- valid format (postal code)
	- custom business rule

Java's Standard Bean Validation API
* Java has a standard Bean Validation API
* Defines a metadata model and API for entity validation
* Not tied to either the web tier or the persistence tier
* Available for server-side apps and also client-side JavaFX / Swing apps
* http://www.beanvalidation.org

Spring and Validation
* Spring version 4 and higher supports Bean Validation API
* Preferred method for validation when building Spring apps
* Simply add Validation JARs to our project

Bean Validation Features
* is field required
* validate length
* validate numbers
* validate with regular expressions
* custom validation
* ..

Validation Annotations
* @NotNull - checks that the annotated value is not null
* @Min - must be a number >= value
* @Max - must be a number <= value
* @Size - size must match the given size
* @Pattern - must match a regular expression pattern
* @Future / @Past - date must be in future or past of given date
* ..

Road Map
1. set up our development environment
2. required field
3. validate number range: min, max
4. validate using regular expression (regexp)
5. custom validation


Hibernate
* Hibernate started as an ORM project
* But in recent years, they have expanded into other areas
* They have a fully compliant JSR-303/309 imlementation
	- not tied to ORM or database work ... separate project
* http://www.hibernate.org/validator

* Development Process
1. Download Validation JAR files from Hibernate website
2. Add JAR files to project


Checking for Required Fields
* Development Process
1. Add validation rule to Customer class
	- @NotNull, @Size
2. Display error messages on HTML form
	- form:errors
3. Perform validation in the Controller class
	- @Valid: perform validation rules on Customer object
	- BindingResult holds the results of validation rule
4. Update confirmation page

NOTE:
The BindingResult parameter must appear immediately after the model attribute.
	- Spring MVC validation rules will be ignored if placed in any other location


Add Pre-processing Code with @InitBinder

White Space
* Our previous exapmle had a problem with white space
	- Last name field with all whitespace passed ... YIKES!
	- Should have failed!
* We need to trim whitespace from input fields

@InitBinder
* @InitBinder annotation works as a pre-processor
* It will pre-process each web request to our controller
* Method annotated with @InitBinder is executed
* We will use this to trim Strings
	- Remove leading and trailing white space
* If String only as white spaces ... trim it to null
* Will resolve our validation problem


Validating a Number Range
* Add a new input field on our form for: Free Passes
* User can only enter a range: 0 to 10

* Development Process
1. Add validation rule to Customer class
2. Display error messages on HTML form
3. Perform validation in the Controller class
4. Update confirmation page


Applying Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions
* A sequence of characters that define a search pattern
	- this pattern is used to find or match strings
* Regular Expressions is like its own language (advanced topic)
	- I will assume you already know about regular expressions
* If not, then plenty of free tutorials available
	- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/
	
Validate a Postal Code
* Add a new input field on our form for: Postal Code
* User can only enter 5 chars / digits
* Apply Regular Expressions

* Development Process
1. Add validation rule to Customer class
2. Display error messages on HTML form
3. Update confirmation page


How to handle input for Integer fields - Custom Message
* Development Process
1. Create custom error messages
	- src/resources/messages.properties
	- typeMismatch.customer.freePasses=Invalid number
		-> typeMismatch: Error type
		-> customer: Spring model attribute name
		-> freePasses: Field name
		-> Invalid number: Our custom message
2. Load custom messages resource in Spring config file
	- WebContent/WEB-INF/spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml
	

Custom Form Validation
* Perform custom validation based on your business rules
	- our example: Course Code must start with "LUV"
* Spring MVC calls our custom validation
* Custom validation returns boolean value for pass / fail (true/false

Create a custom Java Annotation ... from scratch
* So far, we've used predefined validation rules: @Min, @Max, ...
* For custom validation ... we will create a Custom Java Annotation
	- @CourseCode

* Development Process
1. Create custom validation rule
	a. Create @CourseCode annotation
	b. Create CourseCodeConstraintValidator
		- Helper class: contains our custom business logic for validation
2. Add validation rule to Customer class
3. Display error messages on HTML form
4. Update confirmation page


FAQ
Question: Is it possible to integrate multiple validation string in one 
				annotation? For example, validate against both LUV and TOPS
Answer: Yes. Steps:
1. Update CourseCode.java to use an array of strings

2. Update CourseCodeConstraintValidator.java to validate against array of strings

3. Update Customer.java to validate using array of strings
